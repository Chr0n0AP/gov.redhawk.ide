	 * Takes a file name and creates the Automake derived variable name used in a Makefile.
	 * <p />
	 * For example, suppose you are creating a library like so:
	 * <p />
	 * <code>lib_LIBRARIES = libmumble++.a</code>
	 * <p />
	 * The library's sources need to be specified, and for that the derived variable name is needed to create the
	 * appropriate rule. That rule might look something like:
	 * <p />
	 * <code>libmumble___a_SOURCES = a.cpp b.cpp</code>
	 * <p />
	 * This method transforms the input "<code>libmumble++.a</code>" into "<code>libmumble___a</code>" for use as a
	 * prefix.
